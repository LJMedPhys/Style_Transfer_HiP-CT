# Style Transfer HiP-CT

Project to apply Style Transfer between HiP-CT and Clinical CT using CycleGANs + Preprocessing.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing style transfer between High-resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HiP-CT) and Clinical CT images. The approach leverages CycleGANs for unpaired image-to-image translation, along with preprocessing routines to prepare the datasets.

## Features

- End-to-end preprocessing pipeline for HiP-CT and Clinical CT
- CycleGAN implementation for style transfer
- Utilities for data loading, augmentation, and result visualization
- Evaluation metrics and scripts

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- scikit-image
- OpenCV
- (add other dependencies as required)

You can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LJMedPhys/Style_Transfer_HiP-CT.git
    cd Style_Transfer_HiP-CT
    ```

2. Prepare your datasets:
    - Place HiP-CT and Clinical CT images in the respective folders under ./data/
    - Update configuration files as needed

3. Run preprocessing:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

4. Train the CycleGAN:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config configs/config.yaml
    ```

5. Generate style-transferred images:
    ```bash
    python test.py --config configs/config.yaml --weights checkpoints/latest.pth
    ```
